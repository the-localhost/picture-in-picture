# Picture In Picture
This web app allows us to have entire screen/a window/a tab in picture-in-picture mode.

We can then easily move the mini-screen all around the screen.

The mini-screen is resizable and floats over all other applications.

So, this means you can watch a tutorial while also coding along with it.

You can fork/clone this project OR enjoy online version [here](https://the-localhost.github.io/picture-in-picture/).

### Steps:
1) Open the above link (or open index.html if you've cloned the project).
2) You'll be prompted to select the media that you want to share in mini-screen.
    * Entire screen: Shares whatever is visible on your screen.
    * Window: You can choose which window you want in picture-in-picture.
    * Chrome Tab: You can select a particular tab to share.
3) After selecting it, click **Share**.
4) Now, click the big **START** button in the middle of the page.
5) You can **resize** and **move** the screen, according to your wish. ENJOY!

#### Note
This project is tested by me specifically on [Google Chrome Web Browser](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/). I'd recommend to use the same.

### FEEDBACKS are welcome.
